        You already have! You earned 100 coins when you first signed up. There are other ways to earn coins too. You get 5 coins every time a user votes for your feature suggestion. If your suggestion wins, you also get refunded the coins you paid to submit the
        suggestion. <br> You can also refer other users to UnicornAttractor using your unique link below. For every user that signs up using that link, you earn 200 coins. They’ll also get an additional 100 coins upon signup. Alternatively, you
        can enter their email address below, and we’ll send the link for you.
